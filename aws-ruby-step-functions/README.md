# Serverless AWS Ruby Step Functions

This is an example of using `AWS Step Functions` `Standard` Workflow Type. It uses `AWS Lambda`, `DynamoDB` (create and update, 2 separate databases), and `flows` from `Step Functions`.


## Diagram

![diagram](./images/step-functions-diagram.png)

The workflow used as an example is organising a holiday for example out of town. 

Here we have two dynamodb tables:

- `tickets` table for tickets
- `parking-lot-spaces` table for parking spaces


The workflow first creates a record for us to buy a ticket, and to book a parking space (as Parallel state), and then waits for the day on which the tour is to take place (Wait State timestamp as check_in_date), and it checks the weather.

Depending on the weather, the workflow is successful if the weather is good. Otherwise (bad weather), both the ticket and the parking space are cancelled.

This can be considered a Saga pattern.

## Setup

`npm install` to install all needed packages.

## Deployment

In order to deploy the service run:

```bash
sls deploy
```

for deploying with a specific `profile` (located in `~/.aws/credentials`) you can simply use the command:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=YOUR_PROFILE_NAME sls deploy
```

for deploying to the specific stage, let's say `staging` do:

```bash
sls deploy --stage staging
```

The expected result should be similar to:

```bash

```

## Usage


After the deployment, go to the AWS Dashboard, and enter Step Functions page. You will see a newly created state machine.

Open the  `organize-nice-weekend-state-machine` state machine and click on `Start Execution`. You need to provide the input in the JSON schema.

Example:

``` JSON
{
  "first_name": "Daniel",
  "last_name": "Ani",
  "check_in_date": "2021-07-11T19:35:07+00:00",
  "check_out_date": "2021-07-11T19:35:07+00:00",
  "driver_plate": "RUBY"
}
```

![example-payload](./images/example_payload.png)

The `check_in_date` is the most important one. Without it, the state machine will be failed (it's needed for the purpose of the Wait state).

![wait-step-example](./images/wait-state.png)


Later on, simply start the excecution.

You can watch live as the change between states takes place. It is also possible to view every parameter going in and out of each state.

The` weather` attribute is returned randomly (either `good` or `bad`), so sometimes you need several executions of the state machine to get a failed execution.

![output-data](./images/output-data.png)

To check created records check your DynamoDB tables (both for tickets, and parking lot spaces). In both cases, you will see that for failure executions, the `current_status` for records, will be changed to `canceled`.

Happy Path (good weather)

Unhappy path (bad weather)

## Log retention

The log retention is setup for 30 days. To change it simply change the value of this attribute in `serverless.yml` file:


``` bash
logRetentionInDays: 30
```

## Advanced configuration
More options (like alerting in case of failed excecutions), could be found in the plugin [repository](https://github.com/serverless-operations/serverless-step-functions).

## Serverless plugins

For this example, there are two serverless plugins used:

| Plugin                | Explanation                                                                                    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [serverless-ruby-layer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-ruby-layer) | For bundling ruby gems from `Gemfile` and deploys them to the lambda layer.                      |
| [serverless-step-functions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-step-functions)       | Serverless Framework plugin for AWS Step Functions. |

## Ruby gems

| Gem                | Explanation                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `aws-sdk-dynamodb` | It's a part of the AWS SDK for Ruby. Used for DynamoDB, in the case of this example - the creation of the new record.          |

## Remove service

To remove the service do:

```bash
sls remove
```
And the stack will be removed from the AWS.
